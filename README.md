# Personal Website-

Project Overview
This website consists of three main pages:

Resume: A detailed page containing my professional background, education, and skills.

Cover Letter: A personalized letter explaining my career aspirations and how I align with the roles I am pursuing.

Career Goals: A page dedicated to my short-term and long-term career objectives.

Technologies Used
HTML: For creating the structure and content of each page.

CSS: For styling the website and ensuring it is responsive and visually appealing.

External Stylesheet: All the styles are located in a separate style.css file for better organization and maintainability.

How the Website Was Built
HTML Structure:

I created individual HTML files for each page (index.html, cover-letter.html, career-goals.html).

Each HTML file has a standard structure with <head>, <body>, and appropriate <section> tags for organizing the content.

Styling with CSS:

I wrote a single external stylesheet (style.css) to manage the appearance of the entire website.

The CSS includes general layout properties like flexbox for easy alignment and media queries for responsiveness across different devices.

Responsive Design:

I used media queries to ensure the website looks great on all screen sizes. It adjusts the layout and font sizes depending on the viewport.

Simple Navigation:

I added a navigation bar with links to all the pages. This makes it easy to move between sections.
